# PRODIGY_ML_03
### Cat and Dog Image Classification using Support Vector Machines
### Overview
***This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of cats and dogs obtained from Kaggle.***

### Dataset
**The dataset used for this project consists of thousands of images of cats and dogs. It is available for download from the Kaggle website here. You will need to download the dataset and organize it into appropriate directories (e.g., separate directories for training and testing images).**

### Requirements
##### To run this project locally, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
Pillow (PIL)
OpenCV (cv2)
You can install the required libraries using pip:


pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn Pillow opencv-python
Usage
### Clone this repository to your local machine.
https://github.com/Yuvaramesh/PRODIGY_ML_03.git

**Download the dataset from Kaggle and organize it into appropriate directories (e.g., train and test directories with subdirectories for cats and dogs images).
Update the file paths in the svm_image_classification.py script to point to the directories containing the training and testing images.**
### Run the svm_image_classification.py script:

python svm_image_classification.py
**The script will preprocess the images, train the SVM model, and evaluate its performance on the test set.
The accuracy and other evaluation metrics will be displayed.**
### Results
The SVM model achieves an accuracy of X% on the test set, indicating its effectiveness in classifying images of cats and dogs.
